          I design systems that scale, perform, and reflect how people actually work. My approach blends technical structure with human-centered thinking, so solutions remain clear, usable, and effective as they grow. Whether refining cloud workflows, building dashboards, or developing client-facing tools, I focus on adaptability, clarity, and strong execution.
        
          My background in engineering technology and cybersecurity, combined with experience in fitness and behavioral coaching, gives me a practical perspective on systems design. I understand how engagement, process optimization, and accountability influence outcomes across both digital platforms and human performance. That perspective helps me build solutions teams can adopt, trust, and sustain.
        
          I work best in complex environments that demand both precision and leadership. I bring structure to ambiguity, create frameworks that support growth and stability, and evolve systems as needs change.
