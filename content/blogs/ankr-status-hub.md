#### 🧠 Project Overview  
As Lead Product Success Engineer at Ankr, I built and deployed a Grafana-based dashboard that monitored 40+ blockchain RPC endpoints across multiple protocols, powering our public-facing Status Hub at [status.ankr.com](https://status.ankr.com).

#### ⚙️ Technical Execution  
The dashboard pulled and visualized live metrics—latency, availability, uptime, and throughput—using Prometheus exporters and API integrations. These metrics were critical for internal observability and external transparency.

#### 🌐 Impact  
The live status page empowered Web3 developers and partners with real-time visibility into node performance. It also reduced inbound support tickets by giving users direct insight into incident resolution timelines.

#### 🧠 Acquired Skills  
- Real-time network monitoring  
- Grafana dashboard development  
- Public incident communication  
- API integration for blockchain endpoints  
- DevOps visibility and alerting strategies
