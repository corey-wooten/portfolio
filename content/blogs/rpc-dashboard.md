#### 🔎 Overview  
As a Technical Account Manager at Ankr, I built and deployed a Grafana-based dashboard that monitored 40+ blockchain RPC endpoints across multiple protocols, powering our public-facing Status Hub at [status.ankr.com](https://status.ankr.com).

#### ⚙️ Execution  
The dashboard pulled and visualized live metrics (e.g., latency, availability, uptime, and throughput) using Prometheus exporters and API integrations. These metrics were critical for internal observability and external transparency.

#### ✨ Impact  
The live status page empowered Web3 developers and partners with real-time visibility into node performance. It also reduced inbound support tickets by giving users direct insight into incident resolution timelines.

#### ✅ Acquired Skills  
- Real-time network monitoring  
- Grafana dashboard development  
- Public incident communication  
- API integration for blockchain endpoints  
- DevOps visibility and alerting strategies
