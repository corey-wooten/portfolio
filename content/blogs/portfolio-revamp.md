#### üîé Project's Purpose 
After maintaining a Wix-based site for several years, I decided to rebuild my personal portfolio from scratch, not only to cut hosting costs, but also to enhance the design and challenge myself technically. My original site cost over $200/year to host online. However, I realized I could host a fully customized, static portfolio for free using Hugo and GitHub Pages, so I dove in.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Tech 
I built the site locally in VS Code, handled version control with Git and GitHub, and used Markdown and HTML to structure content across pages and blog posts. I initially deployed with Netlify but encountered issues with image rendering and static asset handling. Switching to Vercel drastically improved the CI/CD experience, allowing smooth, auto-deployed updates with every Git push. 

#### üõú Domain Setup & Deployment 
To finalize everything, I reconfigured my domain‚Äôs DNS settings to properly route traffic and ensured SSL was active for secure access. This step completed the transition from Wix to a fully self-managed web presence. 

#### üß† Acquired Skills 
This project sharpened my technical foundation and gave me hands-on experience with tools and workflows commonly used in modern web development. Key skills acquired include: 
- Version Control & GitHub Workflows 
  - Branch management 
  - Pull/push commands 
  - CI-integrated commits
- Static Site Generation (Hugo) 
  - Content structuring 
  - Templating 
  - Performance-focused builds
- CI/CD Deployment Pipelines 
  - Automated deployment via Vercel tied to GitHub pushes
- DNS & Domain Management 
  - Routing traffic 
  - Configuring records 
  - Enabling HTTPS
- Markdown & Content Modeling 
  - Semantic content writing with scalable organization
